    NED's Mindset Mission is a character education program that centers around three important messages that have lifelong relevance: Never give up, Encourage others and Do your best. During the assembly, students will learn about the importance of these three life skills while also enjoying storytelling, magic, humor and yo-yo tricks.

<h2>  CV Arrival/Dismissal Procedures 2020-21</h2>

<h2>Arrival:</h2>
  </br>
  </br>
    Buses will arrive at school starting at 9:00 a.m. to enable children to participate in the breakfast program.  
    Student Drop Off: Students receiving a ride to school other than the bus should be dropped off in the drop off loop, parents/guardians should drive through, not park. Your child will be let out and directed to the building by a staff member. We are asking all parents to remain in their cars. Drop off is from 9-9:25... not before 9:00 a.m.  It’s very important that students arrive 
    by 9:25 a.m. to begin the learning and can reach their highest potential. Thank you for your understanding and flexibility as we try out this new system in order to adhere to new safety precautions.
     
    **If your child needs to be dropped off before 9:00 a.m., please make arrangements for him/her to participate in our Latchkey Program. The Latchkey phone number is 215-3255.  Contact the school office for information.*


<h2>Dismissal Time:</h2>
  </br>
  </br>
    <h3>Early Dismissal</h3>
</br>
    A request to have a student excused from school early should be called in to the main office the day of or sent in with them the morning of the dismissal.  The time and reason for leaving should be stated as well as the name of the person who will be picking up the child.  Parents must send in written authorization when someone other than themselves is picking up a student.  Photo ID will be required from ALL adults.  No student will be released for dismissal from the school without a photo ID verified by the Main Office Staff.
     Please be sure to ring the bell outside the main entrance  and wait for directions. Make sure you have your  id with you.
</br>
</br>
    <h3>Dismissal:</h3>
    Pickup: This will be different this year, we thank you in advance for your patience and flexibility as we try this system out and work through any issues that may arise.  Your child will be assigned a block pickup time if this is what you indicated you will be doing for transportation this year (it will be alphabetical and by household). You will arrive at your designated time in the designated loop and wait in your car with your ID for your child. You will have a tag in your car to be displayed that will match your child’s tag. Your child/children will be brought outside to your car after checking the ID of whomever is picking up and ensuring they are authorized to do so and that person signs your child out.  It is important that you are at CV in the correct location at the time assigned to ensure the safety of our students and to ease flow of traffic. If you arrive before or after your scheduled time, you will be directed to park and wait for someone to assist you.
    Please arrive at your scheduled time and carefully review the map to ensure you have a clear understanding of the route. 
    Scheduled times for pickup are as follows(by last name and/or household)
    2:45-3:00 Last names A-J
    3:00-3:15 Last names K- R
    3:15- 3:30 Last names S-Z
    Tardy  Students are late after 9:30 a.m.  All students who arrive to school late must be accompanied to the Main door, ring the intercom, and wait for instructions with their child.  
</br>

</br>
</br>
    <h2>COVID Safety Updates</h2>
</br>
</br>
    As we all know this year will look very different from previous years. The bullet points below are meant to help you understand the safety features we will be implementing that are based on the Health Department's Guidelines and Central for Disease Control.
     
        Students will be required to wear a face mask at all times including the bus.  Mask breaks will be given in each classroom setting on a rotating basis and they will last up to 9 minutes.
     
        Student desks are arranged 6 feet apart to maintain social distancing.  Students can move to the bathroom, and other areas of the classroom to get materials and be within 6 feet with a mask for brief periods. 
     
        Temperature checks will take place upon arrival.  If your child exhibits any signs or symptoms of COVID, he/she will be put in a safe room; the expectation is that a parent or adult will pick them up immediately. 
     
        At West Street and Colonial Village, breakfast will take place in the room each morning for those that would like one. We will offer a grab and go as children enter the building.  At Errick Road, breakfast will be served in the cafeteria, and students will take their breakfast back to the classroom and eat it there.
     
        Lunch will take place in the cafeteria.  At Errick Road and Colonial Village, this will also occur in designated other spaces with 6 feet of social distance.
     
        This year we will not have students bring in birthday treats. You can send in pencils, stickers, or anything that is not food if you would like.
         
        This year we will not allow parents nor visitors into the building.  Parents will also not be allowed to congregate outside the school.  Please note that we are unable to allow parents to escort their child to their classroom on the first day of school to drop off supplies and take pictures.  We also cannot allow parents to congregate outside to take pictures of students coming off buses.  Again, we will not allow any parent to come into the school on the opening day.
</br>
</br>
    Click HERE for grade level supply lists of the 2020-2021 school year. Each student will need a pair of over-the-ear headphones (not ear buds) with a USB or 3.5mm jack.  For your convenience we made a list of example headphones that meet the requirements HERE
